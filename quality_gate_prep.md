### Continuous Integration
- Essentially, the building and testing of software in a constant feedback loop
- Devs work on build code & push it to Source Control (GitHub)
- Testing server (Jenkins), takes that code and builds it AUTOMATICALLY
- Jenkins is used as a testing framework; you can write additional tests for it to run on the code
- It can then push the successful code back to GitHub and merge with master branch AUTOMATICALLY

### Continuous Delivery/Deployment
- Delivery: packaging the code so that it is executable and usable for the customer AUTOMATICALLY
- Delivery: releasing the code through a pipeline AUTOMATICALLY
- Deployment: any changes to app are updated to production environment on AWS/Google/etc
